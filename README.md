# Lambdacalceval
a lambda calc evaluator

# Why does it exist?

I came across this paper: https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf
I wanted to complete the exercises at the end of it, but checking my work by hand got way too tedious.
I realized there are other lambda calculus interpreters online, but I just wanted to try implementing it myself, and I had a feeling I would enjoy using it more than the other ones. With mine, you get to use the original syntax with the lambda symbol, view reduction steps,
and perform normal order reductions.
I hope you enjoy it as well.
